## Taskbar and Start Menu

Centrally Aligned Icons: Unlike the left-aligned taskbar icons in Windows 10, Windows 11 centers these icons, including the Start button.

Updated Start Menu: The Start menu in Windows 11 has been redesigned, removing Live Tiles and introducing a more simplified layout.

## Personalizing File Explorer and System Icons

If you’re not a fan of the new icons in Windows 11, you can revert them to the classic style:

Open Settings: Go to ‘Personalization’.

Icons: Choose ‘Themes’, then ‘Desktop icon settings’.

Change Icons: Here, you can change icons for ‘This PC’, ‘Network’, and more.
